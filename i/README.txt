This directory contains files needed by the jQuery Mobile version of gregsandell.com.  Namely, for the
ability to see my blog posts and shared RSS articles.  (But the RSS part no longer works, or I have nothing
shared any more.)

TO DO:  it may be that only the single file simplepie.inc and blog.css are needed.  Possibly they can be moved one directory up,
and the .php files that link to them should have their paths updated.

There also seem to be remnants of an early 'spike' of my jQuery Mobile solution, which should be cleaned out.
