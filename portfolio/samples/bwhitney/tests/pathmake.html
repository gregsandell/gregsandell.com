If you click and drag your mouse on this page, your coordinates will be captured and
placed into the form in the newly spawned window. You can then paste those coordinates
into your animated object's path variable. If you wish, you can even paste your
page's HTML into this document to achieve greater accuracy. (This tool works in both
IE 4 and Navigator 4.)
