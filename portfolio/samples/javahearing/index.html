<i>Note:</i>
<ul>
<li>These applets are written in Java 1.1.  Not all browsers are fully
equipped to display Java 1.1 applets.  Microsoft's Internet Explorer's
latest versions are Java 1.1 compliant.  Netscape's latest browser
(version 4.06 as of this writing) is compliant with Java 1.1 only by
installing an extension or 'patch'.  You can obtain the patch and get
installation information by going to the Netscape <a
href="http://developer.netscape.com/index_home.html">Developer's home
page</a> and following the link for <a
href="http://developer.netscape.com/software/jdk/download.html">JDK 1.1
Support</a>.  Read <a href="/javaudio/jdk1.1_support.html">
more detail on Java 1.1 support here</a>.
<br>The applet runs well under Internet Explorer and Netscape running on
Unix, Windows NT and 95 platforms.  In my experience, Macintosh
plotforms do not run Java applets as well; the lack of preemptive
multitasking in the Mac OS causes performance to suffer.
