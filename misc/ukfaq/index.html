  <H3><A NAME="howfaq"></A>How was this FAQ written?</H3>

  
  <P>I lived in Brighton, a mid-sized UK city. Cities with a population size
  close to Brighton are Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Derby, Leicester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
  Nottingham, Plymouth, and Southampton. Although the information here might
  not apply to so me of the smaller or more remote towns, I suspect it will
  apply to much of the UK. On the other hand I should give is that Brighton
  is a particularly liberal, free-spirited sort of place that gets a lot
  of foreign visitors: consequently I may have a view of Britain as a slightly
  more &quot;open-minded &quot; place than other parts of Britain actually
  are. One particular warning I feel compelled to give is that I have no
  experience living in London which, being a major world city, has unique
  rules and idiosyncracies of its own. So if that's where you're moving,
  <EM>caveat emptor</EM>: for any given statement I make you should mentally
  append &quot;it may be different in London.&quot;</P>

  
  <P>Also keep in mind the information here reflects a particular point of
  time (specifically, April '93 when I moved to Brighton, until the present,
  January '95). I have no doubt that that many of the facts and certainly
  the prices will all sound very quaint in one or two years' time. I put
  all costs in US dollars for the purpose of simplicity. The exhange rate
  I use is $1.50 to the UK pound, which it hovered around (plus or minus
  2 cents) during most of the time I lived in the UK. Note that even though
  the &quot;last modified&quot; date that I give at the beginning of this
  FAQ may show a more recent date, it does <EM>not</EM> mean that I updated
  the prices at that time.</P>

  
  <P>This FAQ is written by a single author. Ordinarily FAQs are compendiums
  of wisdom on subjects relevant to a large number of people on matters for
  which there are generally agreed-upon answers, but this is not the case
  with this FAQ. This is a highly specialized topic, and includes discussion
  of matters that are of a subjective nature. It has not been exhaustively
  researched like a Frommer's Guide to be equally true for all Americans
  from all sorts of regions and socio-economic levels; rather it's the sort
  of guide where the reader should figure out whether my viewpoint is one
  they're likely to share based on the way I say things. On the other hand,
  subjects of a more factual nature (like electrical products) have benefitted
  from numerous suggestions and corrections I have received by email responses,
  which I welcome and for which I am very grateful (see the acknowledgements
  section at the end).</P>

  
  <P>I've received many positive responses on the accuracy of this FAQ from
  many people for whom it is relevant, that is, Americans who have lived,
  will be living, or currently are living in the UK. Occasionally I get a
  critical (sometimes nasty) reply from someone saying that I generalize
  too much, that I am inaccurate or excessively critical in my assessment
  of life in the UK. Interestly enough, such comments almost invariably come
  from people with no stake whatsoever in the matter of what it's like being
  an American living in the UK, but British readers who saw the FAQ posted
  on the USENET groups uk.misc or soc.culture.british and read it just to
  see what a Yank has to say about their country. If you are such a reader
  please think twice about sending me your criticisms, since the perceptions
  that are true for you may not be true for someone who grew up in America.</P>

  
  <P>I left the UK in April 1995 and have been living in Chicago since.</P>

  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H2><A NAME="elec"></A>Can I run US-made electrical devices (appliances,
  stereos, computers) in the UK?</H2>

  
  <P>Bing! You've just asked the very most Frequently Asked Question regarding
  a move to the UK. The UK, of course, has a completely different electrical
  standard than the US (in terms of voltage, current available, frequency,
  and physical plugs). There is a lot of information to consider here, at
  di fferent levels of technicality; there are no quick answers to some problems,
  so please read carefully. A warning: the advice given here is based on
  my own experience, and the information I have recieved from informed individuals.
  <EM>None</EM> of it should be considered the advice of a professio nally
  qualified electrician. I cannot be held responsible for any accidents or
  lawsuits that occur from following the advice contained in this FAQ.</P>

  
  <P>In my view, your best start is to find a store that deals primarily
  in selling foreign electronics goods, and get a friendly salesman to explain
  the ins and outs of power conversion. Such shops (found only in large cities,
  I'm afraid) will be listed under &quot;Export shops&quot; in the yellow
  pages; you might also try &quot;Freight Forwarding&quot; and ask where
  such shops may be found in that area. Another idea is to ask people who
  work at specialty shops for Asians and Indians (food shops, video stores);
  they may know of a local export shop.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="elecdiff"></A>What are the differences?</H3>

  
  <P>There are four matters relating to using US appliances in the UK</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>the voltage ( US = 120V, UK = 240V )
    <LI>the number of watts the product draws (different for each product)
    <LI>the frequency ( US = 60 Hz, UK = 50 Hz )
    <LI>the plug on the power cord
  </UL>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="elecconv"></A>How can I convert?</H3>

  
  <P>To have a US item run under UK current you need to buy a transformer,
  a product that you plug into the wall and has a US-style jack at the other
  end. The transformer will &quot;step down&quot; in voltage from 240 to
  120v. From there you may want to plug in a US-style power strip and provide
  current for sev eral products.</P>

  
  <P>Next you need to consider how many watts your transformer is providing
  (all transformers should clearly indicate this). The more wattage required
  by the electrical item(s), the bigger (and more expensive) the transformer
  will need to be. Add up all the watts that every one of the components
  wi ll draw that will be turned on at the same time, then throw in 20-25
  extra watts for good measure, and that's about the size you need. So if
  you have three stereo components drawing 30 watts each, get a transformer
  than delivers about 120 watts. Don't try to draw more than what the transformer
  pr ovides: you will be risking the health of you and your electronic components!</P>

  
  <P>Now, on to the frequency of the product, a subject which is notorious
  for causing great confusion. UK outlets provide a frequency of 50 Hz. Transformers
  do not provide a conversion to US 60 Hz; you are stuck with UK 50 Hz. The
  only electrical products that need concern you regarding this frequency
  mismatch are products that contain motors (i.e. things that run fans, spin
  wheels, rotate things, etc.). <EM>But</EM>...there are two kinds of motors
  that will be found inside electrical products, and one type is affected
  by the frequency, while the other is not.</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Synchronous motors <EM>are</EM> affected by the frequency mismatch.
    When such a motor made for 60 Hz receives 50 Hz, it runs at 5/6 speed.
    You will generally find that any product that contains a motor that runs
    at high speed (e.g. hair dryer), or must drive something with great force
    (e. g. power drill) will be a synchronous motor.
    <LI>DC motors <EM>are not</EM> affected by the frequency mismatch, because
    the motor runs on DC (for which frequency is irrelevant) and the DC current
    is supplied internally by the product. Thus, as long as the product gets
    current from a proper transformer, the motor inside will run at the correc
    t speed. Generally, any product which requires only a small motor (e.g.
    Walkman cassette player, computer disc drive) uses its own low-voltage
    (5 or 12 volts) DC motor.
  </UL>

  
  <P>You may ask: &quot;So if I don't particularly mind that a product with
  a synchronous motor is running at 5/6 speed, can I run it safely anyway?&quot;
  The answer is &quot;probably.&quot; I have been warned that some products
  (rare, and perhaps even illegal by UL standards) are rated for no lower
  than 60 Hz, and w ill overheat when supplied with 50 Hz. The only way you
  can be sure is to find out the minimum frequency that the product may be
  run at (which should be 50), for which may need a trained electrician if
  the manual doesn't say so. But if the item is a modern product by a company
  with a good reputat ion, you probably needen't worry.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="elecjack"></A>What are the differences in power plugs/jacks
  in US and UK?</H3>

  
  <P>There is only one type of plug in common use in the UK, a three prong
  plug, larger than the US three-prong equivalent. A schematic below (which
  requires a monospaced font to be viewed correctly) illustrates the differences
  between the blades of the two plugs:</P>

  
  <PRE>

              US:             UK:

                    o               |

                   | |             - -</PRE>

  
  <P>There is an older, two prong plug which apparently is still in use in
  older dwellings that haven't been updated, but I have <EM>never</EM> seen
  them, even in quite old fashioned cottages. So if a salesman selling you
  UK/US adapters tells you need to need to be equally prepared for both kinds
  o f plugs, he's wrong.</P>

  
  <P>The UK plug also differs from the US one in that a fuse is contained
  inside. Until recently, when you purchased an electrical product often
  times it would have no plug at the end of the power cord, which you'd have
  to buy separately and attach yourself. The practice has recently been discontin
  ued (supposedly abolished by law), so you will may not even encounter the
  problem. While we're on that subject, you'll also discover that most UK
  electrical outlets have switches on them, like the switch on a power strip.
  And, like all other switches in the UK (such as those used for room lights)
  the effect of the position of the switch is opposite that of the US: down
  means on, up means off!</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="electrans"></A>What features should I look for a transformer?</H3>

  
  <P>Go for good quality here. The small products that are made for the vacation
  traveler, sold at department stores and places like Radio Shack are not
  just poor quality, they aren't even transformers at all. They try to simulate
  a transformer with capacitors, and they can 'short-circuit', blowing up
  whatever they are powering. You know you are being conned when you see
  a so-called &quot;1600 watt transformer&quot; the size of a portable electric
  shaver, weighing 16 oz and costing $20: a true 1600 watt transformer is
  far larger, heavier and more expensive (see below).</P>

  
  <P>Go instead to an export shop, if you can find one. They tend to carry
  a wide range of authentic transformers. Look at the back of every one of
  your electrical items you plan to bring to the UK, write down its power
  consumption in watts, and take this list to the vendor, and see what he/she
  rec ommends.</P>

  
  <P>Many commercial transformers I have seen only provide a two-prong US
  jack, i.e., no ground, so you'll have to look harder to find one with a
  ground, i.e., three prongs. People with some expertise have told me that
  it can be very risky to bypass the ground plug (with one of those three-to-two-pr
  ong adapters) when using products that require a ground.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="elecshop"></A>Where can I get a transformer, and for how much?</H3>

  
  <P>First of all, you might consider whether it might not be better to wait
  until getting to the UK to buy transformers. There's not much of a market
  in the US for converters, since there is only one electrical standard in
  the US and Canada. Europe seems to be a little more aware of the existence
  of different electrical standards in the world, and thus stores probably
  have better availability and wider selection. Furthermore, for some reason
  professional electrical equipment used at building sites in the UK use
  the US standard of 110v, which means there is a market here for 240-to-110V
  transf ormers capable of delivering a LOT of power. Also, keep in mind
  that all transformers are very heavy: my own 1000 watt converter is about
  4x4x4 inches in size, and about 35 lbs in weight (so you'll have to ship
  it rather than take it on the plane with you). On the other hand, they
  may be cheape r in the US (see prices below).</P>

  
  <H4><A NAME="UKelecshop"></A>UK sources</H4>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>There is a electronic parts catalogue sales company in Britain called
    RS Components which deals in transformers; they deal with the public through
    a mail order company called Electromail, P.O. Box 33, Corby, Northants,
    NN1 79EL (telephone 0536 204555, fax 0536 405555). I hear that a 500w c
    onverter costs $105.
    <LI>A company in the northwest, in Runcorn called Spenfields will make
    up transformers to order. The cost for a 1250 watt transformer with two
    US-type 2 or 3 pin plugs is $328. They take about 7 days to make up. The
    phone number is 0928 572578.
    <LI>I'm told that a hardware chain store in Britain called Ryness sells
    transformers, but I have no further information on this.
    <LI>Maplins supply a range of transformers: Maplins Electronics plc, PO
    Box 777, RAYLEIGH, Essex SS6 8LU, Tel. 01702 552961. Their catalogue can
    be obtained at the UK bookseller chain W.H.Smith.

  <UL>
    <LI>Magellons Essentials for the Traveler (Santa Barbara, CA), 1-800-962-4943
    (they have an extensive catalog). A 1000w transformer is listed as costing
    $118.50, and a 1500 watt at $169.50.
    <LI>Appliances Overseas, in New York City.
    <LI>Rainco of Dallas, TX (800 779 0502) (fax 214 242 0243) sell transformers
    similar to those in the Magellon catalog.

  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="elecdontbring"></A>What items should I not bring?</H3>

  
  <P>Easily replaced items that draw vast amounts of current are unwise to
  bring because the cost of the transformer you will need for them will probably
  be several times more than the cost of buying the product anew in the UK!
  For any given item, take a look at the number of watts they require, consid
  er the cost of transformers you'll need to convert them. It may be much
  more economical to replace them with the same items bought in UK stores.
  This may sound expensive, but if you settle for a cheaper food processor
  to replace your industrial-strength Cuisinart, it won't be bad at all.
  And bes ides, you don't want industrial-strength commercial transformers
  sitting on your kitchen and bathroom counters, do you? Here is a list of
  some items you should just decide to leave at home:</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Hair driers
    <LI>Kitchen appliances with motors: blenders, food processors, coffee grinders
    <LI>Any other item with a high speed motor, e.g. power drills
  </UL>

  
  <P>Your US-made LP record turntables or cassette decks may contain synchronous
  motors, in which case they will run at 5/6 speed, or about 3.2 musical
  semitones too flat (yes, bad enough that it will ruin the music: even John
  Cage's 4'33&quot; will come out lasting 55&quot; too long!). Battery powered
  Walkm an cassette players will be fine, though, even when run with the
  AC cord.</P>

  
  <P>Your American-bought TV sets, Video Cassette machines, and the cassettes
  that are made to play on them, are likely to be of little use to you. If
  you bring both your TV and VCR from home, the <EM>only</EM> thing you will
  be able to do with them (after you've bought the gigantic transformer you'
  ll need to convert the watts) is watch American-made video tapes on your
  VCR. You will not be able to watch British TV broadcasts, or British-made
  video tapes, nor will you be able to hook up a British-made VCR to that
  TV set. This is because both British TV sets <EM>and</EM> VCRs (yes, <EM>both</EM>)
  run on a different video standard than in the US: the standard in the US
  is NTSC, while in the UK it is PAL. Don't be confused by the fact that
  the physical cassette is called &quot;VHS&quot; and looks just like the
  ones back home: they are the same cassette, but the information is encoded
  on them d ifferently. If you want to throw a lot of money at the problem,
  you can buy both TVs and VCRs that can run PAL or NTSC at the flick of
  a switch; I've seen these for great cost at export shops.</P>

  
  <P>Beware of &quot;amateur advice&quot; in this area...people will tell
  you completely false things that they have never tested themselves, or
  information that was true five years ago. A few people have told me that
  an NTSC VCR <EM>will</EM> play on a PAL TV set (you don't get the color,
  but you will get bl ack and white), but frankly I wouldn't bank on it.</P>

  
  <P>Digital radios (car radios, Hi-Fi tuners) may not work, since the channel
  step in the UK is in units of 9kHz, while in the US it is 10. So your US-made
  radio may &quot;miss&quot; all the right frequencies.</P>

  
  <P>Some people are so attached to US-style refrigerators and washer/driers
  (and I can't say I blame them) that they buy special US products that can
  run on UK current and have them shipped to the UK. I've seen such things
  in export shops, and I hear that they are available at US Army bases in
  the UK as well. But save yourself supreme embarrassment and measure the
  doors and hallways of the house you will be living in; will the products
  fit through the door? One reason that the UK version of these products
  are smaller is due to a smaller sized door standard.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="elecbring"></A>What items should I bring?</H3>

  
  <P>Provided you use the proper transformer, you can expect these items
  to work in the UK.</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>CD players. Manufacturers make them so the motors are internally supplied
    with the correct frequency.
    <LI>Personal Computers. The motors in their disk drives are internally
    supplied with the correct frequency.
  </UL>

  
  <P>If you're lucky, perhaps the item you want to bring runs on <EM>both</EM>
  standards of current and frequency. The good news is that more and more
  products are being built this way, especially consumer stereo items, and
  computers. You can find out if you have such a product by looking near
  the spot where the power cord comes out: if it says something like &quot;AC
  100-240, 50/60 Hz&quot;, you are in luck. You won't need a transformer
  at all, just a plug converter. Make sure to check this for every product
  that needs to be plugged in. Good news for Apple Macintosh users: everything
  after the M ac Plus was made in this fashion (although check the back to
  make absolutely sure).</P>

  
  <P>If it turns out you have several such products, you could get a mere
  plug converter, plug in a US power strip to it, and then plug all your
  components in (although you do <EM>not</EM> want a power strip with a surge
  protector, since it will freak over receiving 240v). Of course this practice
  is very risky: someone who is not aware of what this strip is being used
  for may mistakenly plug in a US product that does not handle its own conversion,
  and you'll fry it (and maybe yourself). Caution is advised!</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="elecphone"></A>Will phone items (modem, answering machine)
  work?</H3>

  
  <P>Yes, provided you supply the correct adapter for the different standard
  of phone plug and the correct power, modems, answering machines and extension
  cables will work on the British phone system. (I am not sure if phones
  themselves will work.) However, I should point out that it is technically
  il legal to do so. The only products which may legally be hooked up to
  the phone lines are those with a special BT green sticker of approval.</P>

  
  <P>Buying the correct adapter can be tricky. Believe it or not, it is a
  rather frequent occurrence to buy a US-UK adapter and have it not work
  because it is <EM>incorrectly made</EM>! Apparantly, US telephones use
  pins 3 and 4 in their jacks, while British ones use 2 and 5, and companies
  who make connectors will actually get this wrong. I have only heard of
  this happening with connectors purchased in the UK; the US-made US-UK adapter
  that I bought at an export shop worked fine.</P>

  
  <P>The British phone ring poses a rather obscure problem to US-made answering
  machines. The US phone ring goes &quot;ring (pause) ring (pause)&quot;
  while the UK one goes &quot;ring-ring (pause) ring-ring (pause).&quot;
  Unfortunately the US-made answering machine will regard each double-ring
  as two single rings, and thus the answering mechanism will kick in sooner.
  If your phone is far away from you, you may find it frustrating to have
  the machine kick in before you get to the phone (I certainly do). You are
  best off if you own a machine that lets you control the number of phone
  rings before answering to a high number like eight. Or, you could simply
  buy one made in the UK, although I don't think they are as well made or
  as full of as many features as ones available in the US.</P>

  
  <P>They're just starting to get fancy phone services such as call-waiting
  here. You'll have to inquire how to turn such features off if necessary
  (i.e. for modems).</P>

  <H2><A NAME="move"></A>How should I transport my belongings to the UK?</H2>

  
  <H3><A NAME="moveintro"></A>Intro</H3>

  
  <P>Bing again! This is the second most frequently asked question. People
  living abroad for a while tend to want to bring a larger amount of possessions
  with them than can be brought along as luggage on the plane. Here's a guide
  to the various methods for doing so. One bit of advice: before selec ting
  any one company, call around and compare prices. You'll be surprised how
  much they vary!</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="movefreight"></A>Freight Forwarding</H3>

  
  <P>I start with the method I used, which I decided to be the best value
  for the money of all the available methods. I engaged a &quot;Freight Forwarding&quot;
  service, which performed the services of enclosing my items with a crate,
  insuring it, shipping it by sea, and arranging for an equivalent UK firm
  to re ceive the crate (thus there are two companies with which you make
  a financial transaction). These kinds of firms are probably available only
  in port cities, unfortunately (on a coast, or one of the Great Lakes, or
  maybe even the Mississippi River).</P>

  
  <P>One advantage is that almost anything can be shipped by this method:
  sofas, refrigerators, even automobiles are handled by these companies.
  In the warehouse of the company I used I saw a Mercedes being prepared
  for delivery, and a crate of household belongings the size of a medium
  sized bedroo m!</P>

  
  <P>The crate I shipped contained 3 boxes of books, 3 boxes of household
  items, a large box of clothing, a button accordian, and two mountain bikes
  in their boxes. The crate measured 38 CF (cubic feet). The overall cost
  of this shipment, from start to finish, came to about $896, which we found
  a tolerable price to pay. Here's how the costs broke down, more or less:</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Charges on the US end:
    <UL>
      <LI>$3.75 per CF basic cost
      <LI>$1.90 per CF to build the crate
      <LI>$75 handling charge
      <LI>$7.50 communications charge
      <LI>Insurance costs 3% of the total estimated value of the belongings (which
      we calculated to be $8284).
    </UL>
    <LI>Charges on the UK end (in US dollars):
    <UL>
      <LI>$1.50 per CF
      <LI>Customs charge ($81)
      <LI>Delivery from London to Brighton ($105)
    </UL>
  </UL>

  
  <P>The UK company would accept only money order or cash as a form of payment.
  Regarding crating the items: another option is to have them put your stuff
  on a pallet and shrink-wrap the whole thing; they call this &quot;palletizing&quot;.
  Presumably that means they don't try to stack stuff on your shipment (b
  ut how can you be sure?). The cost for this was a flat rate of $20. We
  felt much safer using the crate method. The Freight Forwarding company
  will require a fairly detailed packing list of the items in your shipment,
  with an estimated value for each. Your shipment <EM>will</EM> be submitted
  to inspection by customs authorities at the UK end. This could range from
  them merely examining your packing list, possibly taking a quick peek under
  to lid to see if it looks believable, to a full examinaton of every item
  in your crate. The receiving freight company acts on your behalf at the
  custo ms ceremony, but you can attend if you want to take the trip into
  London (or wherever). See another section of this FAQ for details about
  <A HREF="#duties">customs and paying import duty</A>.</P>

  
  <P>Our stuff (coming from California) had to go through the Panama Canal
  to get to England. It was estimated to take one month to deliver; in reality
  it came to just about two! No doubt it will be quicker if your shipment
  is leaving from any of the other coasts, or via the St. Lawrence Seaway,
  bu t keep in mind that sometimes your crate sits around in a warehouse
  for a while (weeks, maybe) before they find which vessel it will go on.
  There was virtually no damage to any of our belongings, and the customs
  ceremony was completely unremarkable.</P>

  
  <P>The cost of shipping that Mercedes, by the way...I asked...was around
  $900, which struck me as tolerable. That was probably not including crating
  and insurance, though.</P>

  <H3><A NAME="moveair"></A>Air Freight</H3>

  
  <P>Standard airlines such as United have a separate freight shipping service,
  and you can even make sure it goes on the same plane as you're traveling
  on. It's expensive, but not as much as I'd thought. You wouldn't want to
  ship a whole household, but smaller fragile items, or things you have to
  hav e immediately might be handled this way. Charges are obscure: they
  use a formula that takes into account both weight and size. One agent mentioned
  $2.83 per pound as a sort of ballpark figure. Virgin Atlantic charges $2.50
  per kilogram up to 100kg, $2 per kilogram if it's over 100kg.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="movebag"></A>Extra baggage on passanger flight</H3>

  
  <P>Between $76-85 for each extra checked piece not exceeding 62&quot; (height,
  depth, width added together) and 70lbs. If larger than 62&quot;: $152.00.
  If heavier than 70 lbs: $228.00. Bicycles have a special arrangement where
  they are treated as a standard extra item ($76) even if over 62&quot;.
  If your bike is over 70lbs, I recommend getting your money back from the
  guy who sold it to you.</P>

  
  <P>Note that if you are sending computer or other fragile equipment this
  way, the airline does NOT insure it in any way against damage. If you decide
  to ship a computer this way anyway, to be safe, use the original box with
  the original packing materials. If you don't have these, there are packin
  g companies that make made-to-order injected-form packing for any item
  (we did this on a Mac monitor and CPU at the cost of $70).</P>

  <P>The costs quoted to me by these companies sounded very high. I was told
  that a 250-lb box of stuff could run $700-$1250 depending on size and dimensions.
  It appears that the companies engage a freight forwarding company to do
  their work for them, the very thing you can do on your own (see <A HREF=
  "#movefreight">earlier</A>). The advantage is of course that they will
  handle the delivery door-to-door from US to UK. If your new employer in
  the UK is picking up moving costs (they call it &quot;removals&quot; in
  the UK), this might be the easiest way to do things.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="possessions"></A>What should I do with my possessions in the
  US while I'm away? <EM>(This section has been written since I've returned
  to the U.S., so you get the benefit of learning from my errors :-) </EM></H3>

  
  <P>My time in the UK lasted 2 years, and I wasn't a homeowner at the time
  that I took the job, so I had to do something with all my belongings. Furthermore,
  I had no inkling what part of the US I'd be living in when I returned.
  If any of this applies to you, you may find the following useful. </P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="storage"></A>How should I store my possessions?</H3>

  
  <P>It cost us about $600 a year to keep our US household (1 bedroom) in
  a storage locker (Public Storage). This, actually, was a bargain compared
  to other storage locker services we could have tried. Make sure to shop
  around for the best deal; you may find <EM>widely</EM> varying rates! So
  two years cost us $1200. Sound like a lot? Read ahead.</P>

  
  <P>We ended up relocating to Chicago, and the stuff was stored in California.
  The cost of moving our stuff (United Van Lines) was almost $3000...more
  than twice the cost of two years of storage. When the stuff finally arrived,
  we had mixed feelings about lots of the stuff. We wanted to get rid of
  several boxes of books. There were boxes of clothes that had come to be
  of little use to us at the time we moved, and now were 100% useless. We
  had pieces of furniture, cheap stuff, that was heavy and we no longer wanted.
  We should have tried to sell a lot of that stuff before we moved...or tried
  to sell it before United put it on their truck.</P>

  
  <P>We made two huge financial mistakes. First, we didn't get a binding
  estimate on the move, because the United people have to see the stuff up
  close, and it just seemed like too much cost and trouble to fly out there
  just to watch them make an estimate. Second, we considered flying out to
  try to sell off the stuff, but that too sounded like too much cost and
  trouble. Wrong on both counts...the $400 (at most) plane ticket would have
  been a tiny fraction of that total bill. And in the case of the estimate,
  we might have gotten off with paying around half that amount... they usually
  underestimate (salesman wants his commission), and when the driver discovers
  the shipment is 1500 pounds over estimate, well that's his tough luck.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="throwaway"></A>What stuff should I sell or throw away?</H3>

  
  <P>This is one of those highly personal questions, but I'll try to shed
  some light on it for you. Unless your car has some special value to you,
  sell it. Anyone with good economic sense will tell you why: it will simply
  depreciate sitting out there in a driveway. (It will also cause you anguish
  abroad as you worry about all the parts that are gumming up with disuse.)
  If you can get a good price for it, sell it, put the money in the bank
  and let it earn interest, and don't touch it until you come back. Presto,
  you've got money to buy another car.</P>

  
  <P>I'll add another remark about cars. If you are either selling your car
  or storing it in a garage or driveway, you will probably be either slimming
  your insurance coverage down to basic theft and vandalism, or dropping
  it altogether. Now here's where you can <EM>really</EM> get ripped off
  when you come back. If you do drop your insurance, and then want insurance
  again, you're viewed as &quot;trouble&quot; by the insurance company <EM>because
  you haven't had any car insurance in the last six months</EM>. The mindset
  of insurance companies is (and there's nothing you can do to change it)
  that if you were without insurance for a while, there is probably some
  sinister reason behind it...you lost your license, you killed someone in
  an accident...yep, they think pretty negatively. There is nothing in their
  &quot;system&quot; to account for someone going abroad for a year to work.
  <EM>The upshot is that the cost of your insurance may double in the first
  year that you return to the US.</EM> So my advice to you is to have a talk
  with your current carrier, and ask them what options you have for staying
  on the books in their company.</P>

  
  <P>If you happen to be an academic and you have lots of books, take a hard
  look at taking this opportunity to unload as much as you think you don't
  actually need. The weight of boxes of books <EM>really</EM> adds up and
  makes a moving bill huge rather quickly.</P>

  
  <P>Cruddy furniture that you bought cheap and you don't like particularly
  even now. You'll hate the sight of it when you come back. Unless you think
  you're going to be flat broke when you come back, sell it or give it away.</P>

  
  <P>I also had lots of files of papers that I could have gotten rid of.
  The one area that I'd suggest caution in is anything with sentimental value...this
  stuff is what you'll be glad to see again one day.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H2><A NAME="takestuff"></A>How much of my stuff should I take?</H2>

  
  <P>Assuming you are only making a temporary move to the UK, there will
  no doubt come the time when you agonize over what things you should leave
  behind and what you should take. Obviously this is a personal matter, but
  here is some advice based on my experience.</P>

  
  <P>If you particularly like to cook, take your favorite cookware with you.
  You'll hit yourself for having to pay all over again (at higher prices)
  for the favorite cast iron saucepan that you use for making spaghetti sauce,
  say. Don't bother taking silverware and plates, since rented accomodation
  s are frequently furnished with such in the UK (see <A HREF="#furnished">elsewhere</A>).
  A good idea is to make photocopies of your favorite recipes rather than
  bringing several enormous cookbooks with you (and for that matter, bring
  US measuring spoons and measuring cups with you, since they'll b e impossible
  to find in the UK). As far as kitchen appliances are concerned see <A 
  HREF="#elecdontbring">elsewhere</A> for reasons why you should <EM>not</EM>
  bother bringing them.</P>

  
  <P>Use common sense about your clothes. There's nothing profoundly different
  about the way they dress in the UK (except perhaps for women's shoes, which
  have 2-3&quot; platforms these days), so bring whatever it is you need
  and like to wear. Clothes <EM>are</EM> more expensive here, and good-quality
  c lothing is more widely available in the US, so if you can afford it,
  go on a shopping spree before you leave.</P>

  
  <P>Books are a very personal matter, but also one involving common sense.
  If you're an academic or technical person, you should of course bring the
  books that you need to have for your work, since replacing them will cost
  far more than shipping them. As for novels and other books for passing
  the time, I'd suggest leaving them all home, since there will be plenty
  of things you will want to buy in the UK. But as for music, I'd say bring
  all your most beloved CDs and cassettes, since they are relatively small
  and overpriced in the UK.</P>

  
  <P>If you're going to be running any of your US electrical products in
  the UK, take plenty of electrical adapters, power strips, extension cords,
  and equivalent items for telephones as warranted; they will all come in
  handy.</P>

  
  <P>If you are moving to the UK permanently, you may wonder whether to bring
  large items such as furniture and cars, or sell them before you leave.
  This is not an area in which I have any personal experience. On the one
  hand, cars are extremely expensive here, so the possibility that you could
  sav e money exists. On the other hand, consider that a car with the wheel
  on the &quot;wrong&quot; side is trickier to drive, less safe, and will
  have lower resell value in the UK. Of course, if you are taking the kind
  of job where a company car is provided for you, you're all set. If your
  furniture is high q uality stuff, it too may actually be economical to
  have it shipped rather than replace it at high cost here.</P>

  
  <P>A slightly different question is &quot;what should I bring on the plane
  with me, to have immediately on arrival?&quot; If you are planning to use
  your US-made answering machine and modem in the UK, that will be useful
  immediately, and will be easy to bring. If these and other such products
  need power co nversion, you'll need a transformer right away; but given
  the immense size and weight, it may be best to purchase this after you
  arrive in the UK.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H2><A NAME="duties"></A>Will I have to pay import duties, VAT, etc. on
  items I bring into theUK?</H2>

  
  <P>First of all, the following is <EM>non-official</EM> information based
  on heresay and unverified personal experience. For official information,
  try the US Dept. of Commerce (202-482-3748).</P>

  
  <P>Anything you bring into the UK, whether with you on the plane, or shipped
  separately is fair game for the customs officials to inspect, and possibly
  liable for import duty. Newly purchased goods (defined as items less than
  6 months old) are the only things that you need to worry about: customs
  can charge you an import duty of 17.5% on these items. A sales slip or
  purchase invoice is considered the proof of the age of the item, so have
  these on hand if you think you might get asked about anything. There is
  probably little to worry about if you are bringing in household-type items
  (&quot;per sonal effects&quot;) and you can prove that you're coming over
  to live and work in the UK for an extended period of time. However, if
  you are bringing in a bunch of new looking products in their original boxes
  (like a personal computer system), I'd say your chances of being asked
  some questions are goo d.</P>

  
  <P>As you enter customs (after getting your stuff off of the baggage carousel),
  you'll see two lanes to exit from, one for where you have nothing to declare,
  and one where you have to declare. I've heard that the rules say that items
  you intend to reexport (return to the US) are exempt from duty ( which
  is why regular tourists don't get charged for cameras and such). So newly
  purchased items pertaining to your job (say, a new Mac Powerbook) can probably
  be considered exempt. I suspect that customs mainly concern themselves
  with snagging people who bring in non-duty-free alcohol and cigaret tes,
  drug smugglers, and people transporting merchandise for resale (like <EM>ten</EM>
  Mac Powerbooks, say).</P>

  
  <P>Our passage through customs and immigration was completely unremarkable,
  despite having six large pieces of luggage. However, we did see two parties
  being submitted to extensive baggage searches (down to examining individual
  scraps of paper). Sad to say, I have read that people with darker ski n
  get stopped more frequently in UK customs.</P>

  <H3><A NAME="healthfree"></A>Will I get health care for free?</H3>

  
  <P>The universal health coverage in the UK is known as the National Health
  Service, or NHS. According to a 1990 source, you are entitled to NHS coverage
  if:</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>(1) you are from an EC country
    <LI>(2) you are from a country with a reciprocal health agreement with
    the UK

    <LI>(5) you have refugee status or Exceptional Leave to Remain
    <LI>(6) you are the wife or child of a person in 1-5.
  </UL>

  
  <P>In my case (as an employed person in category 4), monthly payments towards
  NHS are taken out of my pay like a tax. This amount is $186 a month in
  my case. So I wouldn't exactly call it free, but it gives me medical coverage
  (there is no bill to settle when I visit a doctor) and covers drugs (e
  xcept for a nominal fee of $6.75 for each prescription, no matter how costly
  the drug).</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="healthqual"></A>How is the quality of health coverage?</H3>

  
  <P>I've found little cause to complain about the health coverage here;
  it's been at least as good or better than the coverage I've gotten from
  membership in an HMO in the US. You get assigned a particular doctor, and
  mine is very sharp and professional. If you're suddenly ill you might have
  to be content see another available doctor rather than yours, which of
  course is no different from in the US. The system appears to not be so
  generous when it comes to surgery or special medical treatment: you get
  put on a waiting list that can go on for years. A couple we know whose
  child was put on a two-year waiting list for a tonsilectomy gave up in
  frustration and took a private route. Because this waiting list problem
  gets worse every year as the government makes bigger cuts, many Brits can
  be disparaging about their health care.</P>

  
  <P>My wife Elena and I got to put the NHS to the test by having a baby
  while we were living here and feel we got excellent care. For example,
  the hospital enthusiastically admitted her early to watch her high blood
  pressure; she was able to stay in the hospital for three days following
  delivery si mply because she felt like it; and as part of the standard
  treatment, was given daily visits at home by a midwife for ten days afterwards.
  Our child-bearing friends in the US whose coverage is by HMO all had much
  less generous care (for example, being sent home the day of the delivery,
  even after having a caeserian).</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="healthfit"></A>How concerned are Brits about health and fitness?</H3>

  
  <P>On the whole, Brits seem less concerned about maximizing their personal
  health and fitness than Americans are. In fact (get ready for this one),
  they view America as a nation of &quot;health nuts,&quot; all consumed
  by the pursuit of the &quot;clean life&quot; and a fixation on having the
  perfect skin, body, legs, an d so on. Not long ago an article in a London
  paper on the Irish actor Stephen Rea remarked that, when Rea ordered mineral
  water (rather than beer) during the interview, it was telling proof that
  he'd &quot;gone Hollywood.&quot; The book &quot;Brit-Think/Amerithink&quot;
  has some funny material on this cultural diffe rence (details <A HREF=
  "#readnon">elsewhere</A>).</P>

  
  <P>Here are a few random observations on health in the UK. Although the
  movement for banning smoking in public places is gaining ground, it remains
  a more a minority sentiment in this country. Pubs are tremendously smoky,
  although thankfully, smoking is not allowed in movie theatres. Probably
  be cause Britain makes some of the best ales in the world, people drink
  a lot (3 or 4 pints an evening is not considered particularly excessive
  here), and they seem to start very young. The institution of The Pub is
  an omnipresent, essential public facility; for example, Universities will
  have not ju st one pub, but three or four spread over the campus. You will
  not see any oriental restaurants proudly displaying a &quot;No MSG&quot;
  sign, and waiters may consider the request unusual. There are many workout
  clubs, but you will not find many men in aerobics classes; the British
  sense of macho identity s eems to regard that as a domain for women. Magazines
  on childbirth, instead of glorifying more natural methods of childbirth,
  contain testimonials from women who were so glad they were drugged up for
  delivery: &quot;It was wonderful, I didn't feel a thing.&quot;</P>

  
  <P>And then there's the incredible amounts of grease and deep frying in
  their foods. In particular, there is the &quot;English Breakfast&quot;
  you will find served at every restaurant and Bed &amp; Breakfast: greasy
  fried egg (although on alternate days, tolerable scrambled eggs), greasy
  sausage, greasy bacon, slices of bread fried in grease, hash browns fried
  in grease, plus the piece de resistance, the small half-tomato fried in
  grease. You have been warned.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="healthdentist"></A>Dentistry</H3>

  
  <P>Technically you can have dental care for free as part of your coverage
  under NHS. However, NHS is very stingy in the fees they're willing to pay
  dentists, making it not feasable for dentists to run a fully modern service
  on such income, so it is very rare to even <EM>find</EM> an NHS dentist.
  So you'll probably want to look for a private practice, not just for availability,
  but in order to get good quality care. One that I've heard recommended
  is called <EM>Denplan</EM>.</P>

  
  <P>It might be advisable to spend a little extra effort finding a top quality
  dentist, since I suspect that the UK lags behind the US a bit in quality
  of dental care. Two US dentists I have talked to, including one who actually
  practiced in the UK for a while, tell me that &quot;preventative care,&quot;
  the cornerstone of US dentistry, is not as widely practiced in the UK.
  Many Brits still regard the dentist as someone you see only after something
  has actually gone wrong, rather than for &quot;checkups.&quot; A Brit actually
  asked me, with a straight face, &quot;what's the matter, do you have a
  bad tooth?&quot; when I asked that he recommend a dentist. If your stay
  in the UK is only temporary and you plan to have visits to the US from
  time to time, you might just make things easier (and give yourself peace
  of mind) and visit dentists when you're in the US. In fact, I insist that
  all dentists I see let me kee p my X-rays, since I never know where I'm
  going to visit a dentist next.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H2><A NAME="cost"></A>How expensive is it to live in the UK?</H2>

  
  <P>This is a tricky area. Sitting at home in the US and pondering your
  move to the UK, you may think it wise to make some calculation using the
  exchange rate, your salary, and the costs of items in the US to estimate
  how much it costs to live in the UK. It all turns out to be more subtle
  than tha t. Different things are expensive here. Once you get here, you'll
  eventually become accustomed to how much a pound can buy you. I can think
  of ways to describe the UK as cheaper or more costly than the US, depending
  on what you're talking about. In general however, I think the argument
  for call ing the UK a more expensive place is slightly stronger. Here is
  some information to help you decide.</P>

  
  <P>If one thing makes the UK a more expensive place, it's certainly gasoline
  (petrol). If you expect to own a car in the UK (and with a quite good rail
  system, you might not need to), expect this to consume a <EM>much</EM>
  larger chunk of your income. If you won't be owning a car, you just may
  be one of those people who think the UK is a cheaper place than the US.</P>

  
  <P>Manufactured goods such as CDs, books, clothes, computers, consumer
  electronics and appliances can be 25-50% more expensive than in the US;
  sometimes it seems like &quot;whatever it costs in dollars in the US, the
  cost in the UK will be the same number of pounds.&quot; This is changing,
  though; for examp le, prices on Macintosh computers dropped radically last
  year.</P>

  
  <P>Restaurants are slightly more expensive than in the US, but food bought
  at grocery stores is not; in fact, it is often cheaper.</P>

  
  <P>Salaries in the UK are for the most part lower than in the US. This
  is considered so patently true by most Brits that when preparing for an
  interview for a lectureship at a British university recently, I was advised
  to be ready to answer the question &quot;Why would you want to work here
  when you co uld earn a much larger salary working in the US?&quot; So it
  may very well be that the salary you will make as an X (engineer, lecturer,
  student) in the UK will provide less purchasing power than what you would
  make as an X in the US. If you are coming here for an academic job (see
  <A HREF="#academic">elsewhere</A>) and with a family, keep in mind that
  it'll be harder to get by on a single income (unless it's a senior lecturer
  position or better). It's even been said to me that an academic career
  pretty much rules out every buying anything better than a second-hand car.</P>

  
  <P>A recent source compared the cost of living in the US vs. the UK, in
  order to figure out how overseas employees would need to be paid. In March
  92, the USA came out 14% less than the UK, but in March 93, the USA came
  out 4% <EM>more</EM> than the UK, for what it's worth.</P>

  
  <P>Overall it appears that the UK does tend to be more expensive than the
  US, but it is not &quot;impossible to live&quot; here (as the exaggerated
  estimates of US tourists who have stayed in expensive London hotels and
  restaurants might have you believe). Not all things that you'd think are
  expensive actua lly are; sometimes they are cheaper than in the US. Brits
  can be extraordinary penny pinchers, and prices for essential items are
  often low because otherwise nobody would buy them. Also, even if you find
  that you can afford less living here, you will adapt quickly, live as others
  do, and not even notice much of a change.</P>

  
  <P>A rather conspicuous source of increased expense in the UK is the nasty
  tax called VAT (Value Added Tax), which is 17.5%. This is like sales tax
  in the US, but it is usually figured into the listed price of an item,
  so you tend to be unaware of it. Just about everything (restaurant food,
  manuf actured goods, home heating fuel) is subject to VAT.</P>

  
  <P>VAT is not the only new sort of tax you'll need to cope with; a list
  of other little expenses to which you'll have to become accustomed, either
  as part of living in the UK or as part of living abroad, is shown below.
  Many of them are discussed in greater detail in other sections of this
  FAQ.</P>

    <LI>Paying to keep your stuff in a storage locker in the US (see <A HREF=
    "#movestore">elsewhere</A>)
  </UL>

  
  <P>Ways in which you may <EM>save</EM> money, on the other hand, are:</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Free health coverage
    <LI>Not needing a car if rail service is convenient
    <LI>Car provided by your company (if you're lucky)
    <LI>One less tax to pay, since in the US you pay federal <EM>and</EM> state
    taxes.
    <LI>More &quot;exotic&quot; vacations available for less money (e.g. a
    summer in the French countryside, a week in Paris, etc.)
  </UL>

  
  <P>To get right down to the nitty-gritty, here are the prices that things
  cost right now (summer 1994). Gasoline is sky-high (remember the US is
  the only country that does not add a separate tax to its gasoline), about
  $3.50 per US gallon. Dinner at a yuppie-style restaurant, with beer and
  a dess ert, runs about $30, while take-out Fish &amp; Chips with a soda
  is only about $4. Renting a Ford Escort from Hertz for a week costs $252
  (insurance included). A 2-3 mile trip in a cab is about $5.50. A medium-sized
  novel is $7.50. CDs are notoriously overpriced, from $21-27 each. A round-trip
  pla ne ticket (they call it &quot;return fare&quot;) to Brussels in July
  is $153; a good bargain on a Paris return flight found in late August was
  $127. A ticket for a movie costs $6, and a videotape rental is $3.75. Some
  items at the store: potatoes are $.51/lb; peas $1.20/lb; green bell peppers
  $1.40/lb; ap ples and bananas $.60/lb; $1 for 6 eggs. A Sony 25&quot; TV
  is advertised for $750. A new, British-made (Rover) economy car costs $9000
  (financing is 18.41% APR). A cheap futon/couch costs $277. A daily paper
  is $.75.</P>

  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H2><A NAME="bank"></A>How can I get a bank account?</H2>

  
  <P>A checking account (sometimes called a &quot;current account&quot;)
  is an absolute necessity here, since (1) you will need a bank account to
  pay your bills, (2) most companies that require a monthly payment wish
  to be paid by auto-debit, and (3) your employer all but requires you to
  be paid by auto-deposit. Banking conveniences are pretty much the same
  as in the US: there are automatic tellers (ATMs) everywhere, you can pay
  with your ATM card auto-debit for just about anything (groceries, restaurants,
  department stores). There are ordinary banks, such as Barclay's and NatWest,
  and bank-like compani es called &quot;Building Societies&quot; (such as
  Abbey National) which are like &quot;Savings and Loans&quot; in the US.
  You probably want to use an ordinary bank.</P>

  
  <P>However, your ATM card is really useful only if it is also a &quot;check
  guarantee card.&quot; This essentially makes it good for credit and insures
  merchants against theft. Without that status it will be useless as a debit
  card, and perhaps more importantly <EM>no</EM> merchant will cash your
  check wit hout it (although it will be accepted as payment for bills over
  the mail). Therefore when you get an account you want to <EM>insist</EM>
  on getting a check guarantee card.</P>

  
  <P>And this one detail may turn out to be the biggest hassle you have to
  go through in the UK. Banks will happily open a plain savings and checking
  account with almost no questions, but they'll make getting the check guarantee
  card almost impossible because you have zero credit history in the UK.
  Unfortunately, no matter how sterling your credit history in the US is,
  no matter how amazing your assets and investments in the US are, they meaning
  NOTHING abroad, and help not one bit towards getting that important card.</P>

  
  <P>Probably the best way win the trust of the bank to give you this credit
  is to ask your employer (someone in the salaries office, say) to call the
  bank to vouch for you. They in fact may be motivated to do this because
  they are eager to find a way to auto deposit your paycheck. Some other
  thin gs that <EM>might</EM> help are:</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Get a fellow employee from your new job who has a bank account at the
    bank you want to write a letter on your behalf
    <LI>Open the account with a HUGE initial deposit so that they will roll
    out the red carpet for you (however, there are limitations on the amount
    of money you can bring into the country with you...see an <A HREF="#duties">earlier</A>
    part of this FAQ)
    <LI>Get someone from your bank at home to write you a letter telling how
    long you've been an excellent customer there, etc.
    <LI>Show them several bank statements from your US account demonstrating
    a nice, fat monthly balance.
  </UL>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H2><A NAME="housing"></A>What kind of housing will I find?</H2>

  
  <P>There's as much variety in housing in the UK as in the US, so there
  is no simple way of advising you on what kind of place you'll be living
  in. Keep in mind that flats in general can be old here (living in a 200
  year old flat is no big deal), so they are likely to look more like Brownstones
  in NYC rather than pre-fab apartments in California.</P>

  
  <P>The primary way flats are advertised are via Estate Agents (why call
  them &quot;Real&quot; Estate Agents when there are no &quot;Imaginary&quot;
  ones?). Go to their offices and ask to see a listing. They will drive you
  around to any of the properties that interest you. Advertisements for flats
  often give the price on a per-week basis, although you actually pay monthly.
  &quot;Hob&quot; (a hot plate) or &quot;cooker&quot; (synonymous with stove)
  are other words you will find in advertisements. By the way, many British
  stoves, even modest ones, have a open broiler on the top, which is a real
  treat: they grill steak and fish mu ch more effectively than the down-below
  broilers of US stoves.</P>

  
  <P>There is a nasty property tax called the Council Tax, formerly known
  as the Poll Tax, which you are required to pay, even if you are merely
  renting the property. The tax is paid only 9 out of 12 months of the year.
  We pay $66 a month for our flat. Good news for students: there is a special
  p rovision that may make you exempt, depending on your living situation,
  so look into it before you pay it.</P>

  
  <P><A NAME="furnished"></A>Furnished flats are quite common in the UK.
  They will include living room (called the &quot;lounge&quot;) furniture,
  a fridge and stove, a kitchen table, and kitchen cookware and utencils,
  and sometimes beds. You can bargain a bit with the landlord on the items
  that are included in t he furnishings (after all, you are paying more than
  for a non-furnished flat). Note that the kitchen cookware includes only
  enough items to cook basic meals. You'll have to outfit them with more
  to make your favorite recipes like fancy omlettes, stir-fried oriental
  dishes, etc.</P>

  
  <P>In the part of the country I'm in, central heating is no longer considered
  a luxury. A flat with independent space heaters in every room rather than
  radiators fed from a central heating source should probably be considered
  fairly &quot;low rent.&quot; The lounge often has, even in a centrally-heated
  dwe lling, a small heater (usually gas) located where a fireplace used
  to be. These are a cherished, cozy item, although some are unfortunately
  festooned with tacky decorations or pseudo log-fire regalia. The lounge
  often has a door on it (to keep the heat in); strangely enough, these are
  sometimes m ade of an opaque glass rather than wood, like something you'd
  see in a hair salon.</P>

  
  <P>Clothes washers are often included in a flat; it's not too demanding
  to include that as one of your requirements. UK clothes washing machines
  tend to be low-capacity and low-speed (they are smaller, usually kept underneath
  the kitchen counter, just like a dishwasher). Some of them, even ones o
  f fairly recent vintage, don't even use microprocessors, using instead
  a primitive mechanical programming system that clicks away like Charles
  Babbage's Analytical Engine. Also, many do not draw hot water from the
  household hot water supply; rather, they take cold water and heat it electrically
  in side the unit. The slow rate of heating the water means that each load
  can take over an hour to complete (but I'm told the ones in France take
  even longer). However, if you pay enough you can always buy as high-tech
  a washer as you like; but what you'll find in rental properties will tend
  to be t he more modest ones. Clothes driers and dishwashing machines are
  less-frequently included items in UK flats. See <A HREF="#elecdontbring">elsewhere</A>
  about bringing washing machines and refrigerators from the US.</P>

  
  <P>UK home showers also merit some comment; compared to US showers, they
  run at a pathetic trickle. Take a nice long shower before you leave for
  the UK, it's the last decent one you'll have for a long time. Water pressure
  within the usual British household is obtained entirely by gravity. Unfortu
  nately, the hot-water storage tank is frequently at a location just below
  the shower head, so an &quot;electric shower&quot; (one that pumps and
  scalds the water as quickly as it can, which is not very) is found in most
  homes. I find rinsing my hair to take so long under our shower that it's
  easier to wash my hair while taking a bath, dousing my head with a pail
  of water. The quality of electric showers varies: one that costs $450 might
  be able to deliver a fair amount of water pressure, but in an average quality
  flat the shower will probably be cheap. At an even greater expense you
  can actually i nstall a pumping system that will give you a good US-style
  shower (it.s called a &quot;power shower&quot;).</P>

  
  <P>The day you move in to your new dwelling, MAKE SURE to have whomever
  is providing the flat show you how to turn on the central heating and water
  heater. The workings, appearance (a square box mounted on the side of the
  wall), and location (sometimes the kitchen) are completely different than
  in the US. Also it includes a device with several switches for controlling
  fuel efficiency. We spent our first weekend in our flat unable to take
  a hot bath because we didn't know where the water heater was!</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H2><A NAME="utility"></A>How do I get utilities (gas, water, phone, etc)?</H2>

  
  <P><A NAME="hookup"></A>Getting hooked up: The experience of getting water,
  gas and electricity bills for your dwelling is fairly straightforward and
  very much like in the USA. It is not nearly as difficult as getting a bank
  account (see <A HREF="#bank">elsewhere</A>), but you are stuck in a nasty
  Catch-22 because utility companies will no t give you access until you
  have a bank account, and bank accounts want a utility bill as proof of
  where you live. (I'll never forget when I pointed that out to a bank clerk
  and he responded by lighting up and saying, &quot;well yes, it is a bit
  like that, isn't it?&quot;) After that is taken care of, they may require
  an initial deposit, since you will not have a previous history with a British
  utility company.</P>

  
  <P>If you are on friendly terms with the previous tenant, it may be to
  your advantage to take over their old phone number, and other utility accounts,
  as it can save a lot of time, money and hassle in hookup.</P>

  
  <P>Utility bills are billed quarterly (every 3 months). Beware of your
  long distance calls to the US...you could be quietly running up a huge
  bill and not know it until your third month here!</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="phone"></A>Telephones</h2></H3>

  
  <P>Note that <EM>every</EM> phone call, even local ones, costs money in
  the UK, and it is billed by the minute. If you use a modem with your phone
  (see <A HREF="#elecphone">elsewhere</A> for information on bringing your
  phone-related products from home), note that it's costing you money to
  be logg ed in! However, a discount rate begins at 6 pm and continues until
  8 am the next morning, so your nighttime login sessions won't be so bad.</P>

  
  <P>As in the US, phone numbers consist of an area code (used only when
  dialing from outside the area) and a local number. Numbers are not standardized
  in length in the UK: the area code may have 3-4 numbers, the local number
  6-7 numbers. Within the country, area codes always begin with a zero; c
  alling from another country to the UK, however, you omit the zero.</P>

  
  <P>For directory information, you dial 192, for operator, 100, for phone
  sales 150, for emergency, 999. I am reminded of Homer Simpson's line &quot;Operator,

  <P>Phones: the BT (British Telecom) system appears to understand both 'touch
  tone' and 'pulse' dialing over most of the UK, as far as I understand.
  The physical phone in your home may one or the other, but even if it's
  pulse, it will respond to tones dialing from your modem or pocket dialer,
  if y ou have one. Pay phones: the standard BT pay phones are pulse dialers,
  but BT's competitor Mercury are touch tone dialers.</P>

  
  <P>UK Phone companies have just begun to offer fancy phone services such
  as call waiting, or message leaving and answering services.</P>

  
  <P>University phones: at my university, off-campus dialing for many phones
  is disabled after 'business hours'. Very frustrating!</P>

  
  <P>Some British pay phones do not take coins at all; instead, they take
  a &quot;money card&quot; that you buy at shops with between 1 and 20 pounds
  of calls encoded on them.</P>

  <P>I still use US Sprint as my long distance carrier, and my wife still
  uses MCI as hers...there are European access numbers for reaching their
  operators. (By the way, France and Germany are about to buy a 40% interest
  in US Sprint.) However, strangely enough, we recently discovered direct
  dialing f rom home is cheaper than our long distance carriers; but when
  you're at a public phone you may need your carrier. Warning: neither Sprint
  or MCI can place calls to Canada from the UK (I haven't the slightest idea

  <P>You may wish to buy a television and VCR (you certainly don't want to
  bring yours from the US...see <A HREF="#elecdontbring">elsewhere</A>),
  but it is rather common practice for people to rent them. If you shop around,
  you might find a TV/VCR combination for as cheap as $27/month. However,
  as you are a foreigner some shops may balk at renting you a set, and even
  then will probably require a deposit of around $150, so getting a TV may
  require some perseverance.</P>

  
  <P>There's a joke that goes &quot;In America you have to have a license
  for a gun; in Britain, you have to have a license to watch TV.&quot; Laugh
  if you like, but it's literally true. You purchase a yearly license to
  watch TV from the Post Office (!), and it costs more for a color TV than
  a B&amp;W one. The license helps pay for the BBC. Trucks prowl around your
  street from time to time and make surprise visits to see if you've paid
  up your license. They even have equipment that tells them if &quot;TV rays&quot;
  are coming from your living room. Go ahead, don't believe me...but this

  <H2><A NAME="finance"></A>How should I manage my financial affairs back
  in the US?</H2>

  
  <P>Chances are you will have at least some bills you have to keep paying,
  so you will want to keep your US Bank account(s) open, and be able to write
  checks on those funds to pay your bills. Also, you probably have some monthly
  statements that you will need to monitor regularly. We changed our offic
  ial mailing address to our UK home for all such bills and statements and
  have had little difficulty receiving them (although it does seem to pose
  their computers a bit of a challenge).</P>

  
  <P>If you have to move cash from the US to the UK, or if you will be living
  in the UK off of funds in a US bank account, using an AMEX (American Express)
  card is a good way to go. You tell them to set up your account in such
  a way that when you use your card at an AMEX cash station (which can be
  f ound in every large town in Europe), the checking account at your US
  bank gets debited. Or you can even use your bank's ATM card to do so. ATMs
  are everywhere, and if your card is on either the &quot;Cirrus&quot; or
  &quot;Plus&quot; networks (look at the back of the card), it will work.
  From either card, the conver sion is done at that day's exchange rate,
  and no more (unlike the money changing service such as Thomas Cook, who
  charge a fee for the transaction). You can also cash an ordinary American
  check at any AMEX office. I think AMEX limits the amount of transactions
  to a total of $1000/month, but it ma y depend on your account.</P>

  
  <P>Given the difficulty with obtaining bank accounts (described <A HREF=
  "#bank">elsewhere</A>), it should behoove you to apply for US credit cards
  before you leave the US, since you will have no credit history in the UK
  and may be flatly denied a credit card. Also take the trouble to go get
  PINs ( personal passwords) encoded on your cards. An AMEX card doesn't
  have one unless you get it put on, and you'll need to visit an AMEX office
  to do so.</P>

  
  <P>Once you have a British bank account, you will also probably be able
  to draw US cash from US ATMs of off funds from your UK bank account during
  your trips to the US. Once again, look for the Cirrus and Plus network.</P>

  <P>If you are employed in the UK and drawing a salary, and you are going

  income tax. Request a &quot;Claim for exemption from United Kingdom Income
  Tax&quot; form from H.M. Inspector of Taxes, and submit it to your salaries

  expect you to pay all two years of those back taxes to her.</P>

  <P>Here was how we figured our taxes at the end of fiscal year 1993 (keep
  in mind that the rules change each year, and depend heavily on what properties
  you own, what investments you have, and so on). If you spent at least 330
  days of that fiscal year outside of the US and the total amount of income
  you earned that year (combined from all sources of income, regardless of

  <H2><A NAME="food"></A>Will I be able to stand food in the UK?</H2>

  
  <H3><A NAME="foodstore"></A>Is store-bought food decent?</H3>

  
  <P>Absolutely ! Your local supermarket will carry very high quality goods
  and fresh produce in large quantities, so you should be able to eat and
  cook at home pretty much in whatever way you like. The produce is as fresh
  as the produce that most Americans eat. At my house we have no problem
  cookin g the way we like: Pad Thai, Baba Genugh, Szechuan chicken, salsa,
  mexican-style cornchips and guacamole (to name some particularly non-British
  selections). Vegetarians and Vegans will find many of the items they want
  at supermarkets, and (in Brighton, at least) there are natural foods stores.
  I f someone tells you that British markets have miserable food selections,
  their experience may be several years out of date (perhaps before Britain
  joined the E.C.). I'd have to say that the US has a bit of an edge on the
  quality of meat, however; beef products taste a little more &quot;grey&quot;
  here, and fish seldom seems as flavorful. One exception is bacon, which
  is much better in the UK (Brits are utterly appalled at the fatty, streaky
  stuff that is sold in the US under the name &quot;bacon&quot;).</P>

  
  <P>British supermarkets (Sainsbury's, Waitrose) are about the same in size
  and appearance of the average American supermarket. The American chain
  Safeway, with the same insignia (although different ownership, I'm told)
  is also found in the UK.</P>

  
  <P>Many American brands of products you are accustomed to are sold here,
  and if not, the British/European version is usually equivalent in quality.
  If there is a particular brand of item that have you become so reliant
  on that you you have been never been able to tolerate a substitute (many
  peopl e feel this way about pharmacy items like decongestants and rash
  creams), you might want to stock up on them before you leave. Also, there
  are many foods that are particularly &quot;American,&quot; such as bagels,
  maple syrup and BBQ sauce, for which UK versions exist, but which taste
  not at all like the real thing. If these are important to you, plan to
  have friends bring them to you when they visit, or stock up on it on any
  of your visits home.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="foodbad"></A>What's this about British food being bad?</H3>

  
  <P>First of all, if you're the type of person who is not picky about what
  you eat, then you can skip this section!</P>

  
  <P>This topic needs to be broken into three main areas: British Cuisine,
  British &quot;Fast Food,&quot; and standards of quality in British restaurants.
  First, British Cuisine. Although clearly not ideal for vegetarians, and
  rather high on fats and cholesterol, its quite delicious when prepared
  well. I hav e had wonderfully satisfying meals of finely seasoned roasts
  with delicious garnishes and sauces both at restaurants and friends' homes.
  So it is unfair to attribute the &quot;bad British food&quot; reputation
  to their cuisine, in my view.</P>

  
  <P>Second, British Fast Food, by which I mean the food that is sold cheaply
  for lunch at pubs, &quot;caffs&quot; or small takeout shops. Here you are
  likely to discover at last that you really <EM>are</EM> in a foreign culture
  (having been fooled at first by the common language). The very names seem
  designed to send chills up American's spines: Sausage Roll, Steak and Kidney
  pudding, Bubble and Squeak, Green Mushy Peas, Cheese and Pineapple Toastie,
  and Pie and Mash. So here the problem is not really one of &quot;bad food&quot;
  but whether you are ever likely to develop a taste for their dishes.</P>

  
  <P>The kind of eating establishment you will want to identify if you want
  to avoid such food is the caff. &quot;Caff&quot; is their pronounciation
  of the word that is spelled &quot;cafe,&quot; and that ought to give you
  a warning for starters. Caffs are the culinary equivalent of the pokey
  little antique shops that ret ired people in the US like to open in low-real-estate
  shopping zones in small towns. They are attempts to run restaurants as
  cheaply as possible in a small shop with only a small domestic kitchen
  stove, quickly prepared food (for example, egg sandwiches with white bread),
  and---no kidding---plasti c lawn chairs and tables for furniture. Although
  they are popular gathering spots for locals, you're not likely to get good
  food there.</P>

  
  <P>Lastly, there are British restaurants, the area in which I cannot pull
  any punches or lay the blame on cultural relativism. As an American, you
  have simply been pampered by high standards. Sure, you'll find good UK
  restaurants and bad US restaurants, but the proportion is distinctly in
  favor of t he US. For confirmation, you'll find that most Brits who have
  travelled to America agree with this estimation. If you've ever been stunned
  to hear a Brit who visited the US talk about how much they loved eating
  at <EM>Denny's</EM>, of all places, you'll learn why after eating at a
  smattering of British restaurants. Of course, if the restaurant is expensive,
  you're probably okay; the advice I'm giv ing here is for moderately priced
  restaurants. Essentially you will have to be accustomed to having a lower
  success rate at finding satisfactory restaurants by chance: you can't just
  take a look at a place, size it up, and estimate its food quality with
  as much accuracy as you probably can in the US. Often you'll find the items
  on the menu to be as inspired and flavorful as TV-dinners, or in worst
  cases, cooked in grease that's been recycled too many times.</P>

  
  <P>As I've pointed out <A HREF="#foodstore">elsewhere</A>, the bad food
  is certainly not attributable to poor quality foodstuffs; the bad reputation
  is due entirely to the way in which it's prepared. I break this down into
  four causes:</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Brits can be notorious penny-pinchers. While Brits like good food as
    much as the next person, they don't think its worth shelling out the extra
    10p to pay for it. Similarly, cooks are inclined to cut costs and cook
    quickly than take the trouble to make good cuisine.
    <LI>An odd sense of what ingredients go together (you find pineapple, tuna
    and sweetcorn in the oddest places, even together sometimes)
    <LI>A dislike of strongly seasoned food; very little garlic or spices used,
    so things taste bland. Even a restaurant claiming to be Szechuan will serve
    barely-spiced food. You'll have much better luck at getting spicy food
    in Indian restaurants, however.
    <LI>Many British recipes involve astonishing amounts of frying in grease
    (see the description of the English Breakfast in the section on <A HREF=
    "#healthfit">health</A>).
  </UL>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="foodrest"></A>Where can I find the restaurants with the good
  food, then?</H3>

  
  <P>By now the picture must sound fairly grim, but it's not. While it is
  true that in a very small town or small villages outside of town you may
  find nothing but pubs, caffs and takeout shops, but if you're in the center
  of a large or mid-sized city you need not worry. You will definitely find
  a han dful of restaurants that serve well-prepared, tasteful dishes. Naturally,
  check your friends for recommended restaurants. But here are a few rules
  of thumb as you experiment in finding them on your own. Italian restaurants,
  for some reason, have a high success rate for delicious food, as good or
  better than the best Italian restaurants in the US; perhaps because most
  of the time the staff and owners are really Italians. Properly prepared
  Fish &amp; Chips is probably many times better than what you ever had at
  home, but by no means expect to find good fare from any old Chip Shop (as
  they're c alled here), so ask around for where the best one is. Vegetarian
  restaurants are rare, but any of the larger cities will have one or two.
  There are good French restaurants here and there, and they're often not
  as costly as you'd think. Indian food can be fabulous, although since there
  are so man y Indian restaurants and takeout shops, the quality can be very
  uneven, so look around. Lastly, there are plenty of Burger Kings, MacDonalds,
  and Pizza Huts, and believe or not, you may get a hankering to eat there
  every now and then when you're in the mood to have some food that tastes
  &quot;like home.&quot;</P>

  <H2><A NAME="travel"></A>Do I want to get around by train, bus, or car?</H2>

  
  <H3><A NAME="mass"></A>Trains and busses</H3>

  
  <P>Despite the recent initiation of a privitization scheme, travel by rail
  (either for long-haul trips or for commuting) is still one of the most
  appealing and best-run aspects of the UK. Unless you live in a remote area,
  chances are that you will be able to catch some train between home and
  work if you choose to, and if close enough to a shopping area, do without
  a car altogether (I do). If you commute to London you can get there amazingly
  fast from most parts of the country. However, note that long trips can
  be quite costly. One-way from Plymouth to London was $52 each for some
  friends of mine recently (and it would be <EM>much</EM> more if they were
  traveling at rush hour); note that renting a car, although less convenient
  in some ways, is a much better bargain ($42/day). However, I get to work
  every day (about 5 miles away) for $1.40 round-trip. Busses are lumbering
  and slow. Yes, the double deckers look charming from the outside, but they
  are really bumpy inside, and if you're the sort who likes to get caught
  up on reading while you commute, it's unpleasant. For longer distances,
  busses (coaches) are cheaper than going by rail, but of course rail is
  always nicer than bus. Many trains make it very easy for bicyclists to
  bring their bikes on board, and a conductor will even open the door for
  you to help you in and out. This is the case with trains that are outfitted
  with a special car that contains a cage for this purpose. If you're old
  enough to remember the Beatle s movie &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; one
  of the songs they sing on the train is performed in one of those cages!</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="drive"></A>Do I want to drive in the UK?</H3>

  
  <P>Driving on the left is a trick, but by no means a major challenge to
  the experienced US driver. Before you get behind the wheel, however, have
  someone explain the rules of a UK &quot;traffic circle&quot; or &quot;roundabout&quot;
  since they involve specific rules of who-goes-first which will <EM>not</EM>
  be intuitive to you (although there are traffic circles in some parts of
  the US, I don't believe the rules of precedence are defined). Better yet,
  take a drive with someone and have them explain what they are doing in
  a traffic circle. The book &quot;Coping with England&quot; (details <A
  HREF="#readnon">elsewhere</A>) shows how it's done. Also the UK &quot;Highway
  Code&quot; is available for a small price at most bookstores. Reading it
  is advised, since there are many signs and road markings which are unknown
  to the US driver.</P>

  
  <P>A US license evidently allows you to drive on the road, since many (but
  not all) car rental companies will rent you their car with only a US license.
  No doubt if you stay in the UK for an extensive period of time you are
  obliged to get a UK drivers license eventually, but I don't have any infor
  mation on that. Passing the driver's test is sufficiently tricky that it
  is advised that you take a few driving lessons; on the bright side, however,
  your license will be good until you are 70 years old! If you expect to
  visit the continent, you may also wish to get an &quot;International License&quot;
  whi ch simply translates the information on your current license into 19
  different languages.</P>

  
  <P>Note that many companies (not universities, unfortunately) provide &quot;company
  cars&quot; for employees, which you can use exactly as if it were you own
  car. It's one of the compensations for salaries being generally lower in
  the UK than in the US, and cars being so obscenely expensive.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="walk"></A>Do I want to be a pedestrian in the UK?</H3>

  
  <P>I'm kidding; this is not really a Frequently Asked Question. But I'm
  <EM>not</EM> kidding when I say that being a pedestrian in the UK is noticably
  different than in the US. And I'm not talking about being careful about
  drivers being on the left (although you should); I'm talking about the
  attitu de drivers here have toward pedestrians.</P>

  
  <P>Unlike the US, where white lines are painted to indicate a crosswalk
  at practically every intersection, there are few such zones of safety in
  the UK; there are just rare &quot;zebra crossings&quot; (like on the Abbey
  Road album cover) with flashing lights that oblige the driver to stop.
  When there's no z ebra crossing at an intersection, drivers do not think
  you belong in the road (and will barrel down on you, expecting you to leap
  out of the way). The fact that they don't think you belong there <EM>even</EM>
  when your were there first, <EM>before</EM> the car arrived on the scene
  (say, if they ca me from around a blind corner), lends an air of uncivility
  to the experience of being a pedestrian.</P>

  
  <P>I thought I'd compare highway codes of our two countries to see if they
  were the source of this societal difference, and sure enough, my sources
  showed that in the US the burden is on the driver to watch out for pedestrians,
  while in the UK the burden is on the pedestrian to watch out for cars.
  Here's what a copy of the UK highway code which I purchased at a bookstore
  tells the pedestrian on the subject of crossing the road: &quot;If there
  is any traffic near, let it go past. When there is no traffic near, it
  is safe to cross. Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may be
  approach ing very quickly.&quot; Here's what the 1992 California Driver
  Handbook says to the driver about pedestrians: &quot;Pedestrians have the
  right-of-way at intersections, whether or not crosswalks are marked by
  painted white lines. . . . Always stop for pedestrians crossing at corners.
  Stop for <EM>anybody</EM> crossing the street. Do not pass a car from behind
  that has stopped at a crosswalk. A pedestrian you can't see may be crossing.&quot;</P>

  
  <P>You might almost say that you don't need to worry all that much about
  which direction traffic is coming from, because you'll have to run like
  hell to avoid getting hit anyway.</P>

  
  <P>To be fair about it, however, it must be observed that roads tend to
  be much smaller here than in the US. Consider that an average road in the
  UK may have been laid down in Roman or Medieval times, and with the cities
  that have grown around them have made widening impossible. As a result,
  ther e is very often simply no room to spare for the drivers, and even
  putting one foot in the road puts you at risk.</P>

  
  <P>Second, I think that I underwent some minor attitude-modification on
  this subject. In the US, a pedestrian will see a giant bus or truck approaching,
  then walk into the crosswalk as though they were royalty, pretending not
  to notice the big vehicle which is now spending a few dollars of brake
  pad wear to stop for them. In the UK, the trucks and busses zoom past the
  pedestrians rather than stop up traffic waiting for them. Which makes more
  sense?</P>

  <H3><A NAME="cycle"></A>Do I want to be a bicyclist in the UK?</H3>

  
  <P>Because of the narrowness of the roads, described immediately above,
  you will often find not only no bike lanes, but virtually no margin on
  the road at all to keep you safely out of traffic. Of course, it's illegal
  to ride on the sidewalk (pavement, they call it here), but I do it when
  I feel my l ife is endangered otherwise.</P>

  carrier, but now most universities have moved to becoming full-fledged
  members of the internet. Most machines have IP addresses and can be telnetted

  of information I have gathered from others over email. (If anyone would
  like to contribute more information, please write, as this seems to be
  a truely Frequently Asked Question.) The British are rather proud of having
  zero incid ences of rabies in their country, and are rather eager to keep
  it that way, so pets are screened with extreme care. One person wrote:
  &quot;All pets (dogs, cats, etc) must undergo a 6 month quarantine. You
  bring the animal in, check it into an approved quarantine kennel (you can
  visit the animal ther e) and if all goes well, take it out after the six

  <H2><A NAME="visa"></A>What kind of Visa/Permit do I need?</H2>

  
  <P>If you are going to the UK for some kind of legitimate employment lasting
  for six months or more, your UK employer should have gotten (or is currently
  getting for you) a Work Permit or Work Visa. If not, any time you spend
  over the six months you're allowed as a traveller will be technically illeg
  al, and you'll be thrown out as soon as Immigrations catches you. I know
  nothing about how student permits work, I'm afraid.</P>

  
  <P>My wife accompanied me to the UK, and she was automatically (well, after
  a visit to a British Consulate in the US) granted a work permit as well.
  In fact, her work permit is less restrictive than mine: my permit is good
  only for the job for which I was hired, whereas hers gives her unrestricted
  freedom in the entire E.C. Not bad, being a spouse!</P>

  
  <P>My work permit allows me to leave and re-enter the UK as many times
  as I wish. If your job renews you for a period extending beyond the originally
  requested duration of the job, they will need to reapply to the Home Office.
  This can take a long time, during which they take your passport from y
  ou (and your spouse...your spouse's passport, that is). But if something
  pressing requires you to travel out of the country, they will let you have
  it back temporarily.</P>

  
  <P>The laws change constantly...call the British Consulate to find what
  the <EM>current</EM> rules are on these things.</P>

  
  <P>In case you have (i.e. give birth to) a child while living in the UK
  (I did, so it's not too silly a thought!), here are some issues of citizenship
  that may interest you. If the mother and father are both American, the
  child can only be an American citizen; he or she does not get dual US/UK
  cit izenship simply because he or she was born in the UK. If someone you
  know tells you something to the contrary it's probably because they're
  unaware of the 1981/83 immigration laws that changed everything. For further
  information, you could call the Immigration and Nationality Department
  of the Ho me Office in the UK at 081-686-0688.</P>

  <H2><A NAME="whatsitlike"></A>What's it like living in the UK?</H2>

  
  <P>&quot;What's it like living in the UK?&quot; has got to be the most
  preposterous question in this FAQ! I can't possibly cover all the aspects
  of life that will pertain to you, and even if I tried, I'd only be giving
  a personal perspective. Nonetheless, I've thrown together a few thoughts
  that may interest you.</P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="wanttogo"></A>Do I want to move to the UK?</H3>

  
  <P>No doubt at some point you'll be forced to decide whether you really
  want to take this position, degree program, or whatever. Although this
  is a very personal issue, I can provide a tiny bit of food for thought.</P>

  
  <P>You have a chance to live in another country for a while? Wow, what
  an opportunity! You want to pass up this possibly once-in-a-lifetime chance?
  I'm sure glad I didn't, is all I can say.</P>

  
  <P>What part of the UK will you be in? Just as you wouldn't want to live
  just anywhere in the US, the UK has its ups and downs. My firsthand experience
  consists solely of living in Brighton, but I've visited a handful of British
  cities, so I can pass on my impressions and echo what I've hear d from
  others; better yet, though, ask other Brits what places are like, and if
  it sounds doubtful, make a visit if you can. I think that if you're going
  to any of Brighton, Bath, Cambridge, Bristol, Sheffield and Edinburgh you
  can't go wrong; all fall within the range of &quot;very nice&quot; to &quot;fabulous&quot;
  in my book. I've found most of Cornwall and Devon to be very lovely, and
  I'd enjoy living there (not many big universities out that way, though).
  I've seen some pretty frightening-sounding descriptions of South Wales
  and Liverpool (in terms of them being industrial, economically hard hit,
  dirty ) that would make me think twice before living there. The weather
  in the so-called &quot;northern industrial cities&quot; (Birmingham, Sheffield
  and Manchester, more properly called the midlands cities) is said by many
  to get pretty grey and depressing in the winter (see David Lodge's books,
  described &amp; elsewhere for some rather candid descriptions of Brimingham).
  You no doubt know of Northern Ireland's reputation, but in its defense,
  what is true about the larger cities (Belfast, Londonderry) is not necessarily
  true about the smaller towns (see Paul Theroux's book, <A HREF="#readnon">elsewhere</A>).
  Before moving to London, try talking to a Londoner to find out about the
  many complications of living there. I love London for its many historical
  and cultural wonders, but with the way the residents complain about the
  crowds and traffic, I'm in no hurry to move there m yself.</P>

  
  <P>Going with a partner (spouse, significant other, etc.) can be a great
  advantage, because even if you're working full time, living in a foreign
  country is a bit like being on a vacation. It's not only fun to share that
  with someone who you feel very comfortable with, and it's comforting to
  have a companion with your accent and set of cultural references. Warning:
  only if you are legally married to your partner will the British Consulate
  issue him or her a work permit to go along with yours (see <A HREF="#visa">elsewhere</A>).
  If you are unattached when you go, here's some food for thou ght: the wish
  to stay in the UK or Europe rather than return to the US may strike you
  (it strikes many Americans), and the best way to make that possible is
  to become a European Community citizen. If you marry someone here, I believe
  you acquire EC citizenship.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="foreign"></A>How much of a &quot;foreigner&quot; will I be?</H3>

  
  <P>While its a matter of debate as to how culturally different the US is
  from the UK, in a certain sense all the English-speaking countries of the
  world comprise one vast extended culture. We're all aware of current events
  in each other's countries (although Brits are much more aware of what's
  going on in the US than the other way around), and we listen to each other's
  music and watch each other's movies. If Clint Eastwood or Emma Thompson
  have a new movie, it's a media sensation in both countries. So if you want
  a <EM>vastly</EM> different cultural experience, you ought to try a non-Englis
  h speaking country.</P>

  
  <P>I seldom see any evidence that Brits have any intrinsic dislike for
  Americans; I've experienced nothing but good will from people here. Mind
  you, they don't particularly want Britain to become &quot;like America,&quot;
  but they find it very interesting to know what's going on in the US. News
  coverage of US events is usually in a concerned, empathetic manner, as
  though they regard Americans as the cousins living &quot;over there.&quot;</P>

  
  <P>Britain is full of people from all over Europe, speaking different languages,
  so being a native English speaker makes you only a semi-foreigner. So there's
  little to worry about &quot;sticking out like a sore thumb&quot; as an
  American, unless you've got one of those expressionless, unmodulated, military-style
  voices (which Brits find irritating to listen to), or an extremely southern
  accent (which Brits find fascinating and charming).</P>

  
  <P>Your accent will even give you a number of advantages: friends on the
  phone recognize you before you even get two words out; people strike up
  conversations with you to find out what you think of their country and
  why you came; and because Brits tend to size each other up by the way they
  speak, you will be completely classless to them and they'll show you a
  little respect by default.</P>

  
  <P>How foreign you feel in the UK may depend on what part of the US you
  are from and where you are going. I happen to think that there are greater
  cultural differences <EM>within</EM> the US than there are between certain
  parts of the US and certain parts of the UK. As an example of that, I found
  the experience of moving from west coast US to northeast US (many years
  ago) to be <EM>more</EM> of a culture shock than my move to the UK was.
  I suspect, for example, that someone from the deep south will find the
  UK more &quot;foreign&quot; than someone from Boston would. Also take into
  account socio-economic and educational issues, n ot just regional issues,
  in predicting whether you'll feel comfortable in the UK. There's a certain
  amount of affinity you share with someone who comes from a similar background
  as you, even though it may be from a different country.</P>

  
  <P>Nonetheless, it <EM>will be</EM> a foreign culture to you in many ways.
  There are British words you may have never heard before (dodgy, pillock,
  punter, nappy), and different meanings of words you may have never encountered
  (suspenders, pants, braces, grass), and learning it all is part of the
  adventure. People grew up with completely different radio and TV shows,
  so there are a million cultural references that people make in conversation
  and TV that will have to be explained to you. Plus there are all the words
  and phrase whose usage that have a subtle, but definite difference. (My
  favorite is the phrase &quot;I don't mind&quot;. In the US it means almost
  exclusively &quot;it won't annoy/bother me&quot;; in the UK it means this
  as well as &quot;it makes no difference to me.&quot; For example, someone
  asks &quot;do you want decaf or regular coffee,&quot; you could answer
  &quot;I don't mind&quot; in the UK.)</P>

  
  <P>Society is run differently (for example, much more social services),
  so people have different expectati ons of, and attitudes toward the government.
  The UK has a completely different history of problems and national events
  that shape the way they view things that happen around them: it will be
  a major eye-opener to you to discover how unique your American point of
  view is. None of this can be expl ained to you, there's nothing you can
  prepare for: you'll experience it in your own way once you come here.</P>

  
  <P>There are what Brits consider to be &quot;typically American&quot; traits.
  Most of these they regard with benign amusement (although they will seldom
  let on that they are having a laugh over you), a few with a little more
  annoyance. Here are the American stereotypes, like them or not:</P>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Bragging, lacking modesty: proudly proclaiming one's accomplishments
    at work or school, or the fabulous vacation they've had
    <LI>Blundering into a situation without studying it first, making unwarranted
    snap judgments, being a &quot;gunslinger&quot;
    <LI>Talking with with your guard completely down, blurting out personal
    things to near-strangers (Debra Winger's character in &quot;Shadowlands&quot;
    was a good example of this)
    <LI>Talking loudly in public places to your friends so that everyone around
    can hear your private remarks (US students riding the tube, if you have
    to tell a story containing the sentence &quot;I was <EM>so</EM> <EM>drunk</EM>
    last night&quot;, say it more quietly, okay?).
  </UL>

  
  <P>Ever hear Martha Stewart (a US media personality who gives advice on
  home decoration and entertaining)? She strikes me as a charicature of &quot;the
  typical American&quot; as Brits see them. It's downright embarrassing.</P>

  
  <P>Will you acquire an accent? If you acquire a full-blown British accent
  I'd say you were either working at it, or you are extremely impressionable.
  You probably will acquire, at most, the faintest trace of an accent.</P>

  
  <P>Make sure to get straight the difference between &quot;England&quot;
  and the &quot;United Kingdom&quot; (and furthermore &quot;Great Britain&quot;
  and the &quot;British Isles&quot;, and even &quot;Europe&quot; for that
  matter). Scots and Welsh can be quite insulted by your referring to them
  as being English, or living in England.</P>

    <LI>per capita GDP

  </UL>

  
  <P>&quot;The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced
  economy in the world, with the highest per capita GDP of all major industrial
  nations. . . . The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial
  centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe.&quot;</P>

  
  <P>(Source: the 1992 CIA Guide)</P>

  
  <H4><A NAME="qualbody"></A>Quality of Products</H4>

  
  <P>Perhaps the statistics above say it all: Americans make more money and
  consume more resources in spending it, but in the world scheme of things,
  the ranking of the British come very close. Personally, I find the UK an
  entirely satisfactory place to live. Fear not, you will definitely <EM>not</EM>
  find the UK to be a primitive place, lacking comforts and material goods
  that you consider essential. Nonetheless there is a noticeable difference
  in access to new technologies and products, diversity and competetiveness
  of services, and quality and price of manufactured goods, with the edge
  qui te definitely belonging to the US (almost any Brit will agree with
  this assessment, by the way).</P>

  
  <P>Regarding new products, British business practice is quite conservative.
  Suppose a new product becomes available, like CD players or microwave ovens.
  The US business and marketing approach is to go &quot;guns blazing&quot;:
  get the product and try to make a million as quick as possible selling
  it. The Br its, however, simply &quot;observe&quot; the phenomenon for
  up to two or three years before making a move, even if its wildly successful
  in the US. Finally it comes out as the &quot;latest thing from the US.&quot;
  As a result everything lags behind in the UK, so whatever the product,
  you can find it made better, che aper and with more features in the US
  than in the UK. There are also some products and levels of quality that
  never seem to come to the UK. They can't seem to make milk cartons that
  open properly here. Cellophane tape (i.e. &quot;Scotch tape&quot;) is appallingly
  bad here (gooey and yellow).</P>

  
  <P>Examples of UK disadvantages in the area of comforts, convenience, or
  material wealth relative to the US are: small refrigerators, slow home
  laundry machines, only four standard television stations, home showers
  with pathetic water pressure, stores closed on Sunday, and expensive gasoline.
  In defense of the Brits, however, it's a matter of how you look at it:
  many of these things could be chalked up to the &quot;comparative wastefulness
  of Americans&quot; with equal fairness.</P>

  
  <P>One important fact to point out is that this situation is constantly
  evolving. Britain has become much better even over the last five years,
  and is still changing rapidly (thus, be careful about trusting any descriptions
  from someone who last lived in the UK over five years ago). In terms of
  a ccess to technology and high-quality manufactured goods, the UK is rapidly
  becoming indistinguishable from the US.</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H4><A NAME="storehours"></A>When are shops and restaurants open?</H4>

  
  <P>This isn't exactly a frequently asked question yet, but it will be when
  you discover that places aren't open according to the pattern you're used
  to. For one thing, the hours that people shop and eat are simply different
  from one country to the next. But perhaps more importantly is that while
  Ame rica is a &quot;catered society&quot; where we can eat or shop for
  whatever we want, whenever we want, Britain is not nearly so. Shopping
  districts pretty much close up around 5:30pm, so if everyone in your household
  is working, life can be tough. Travel agents and car rental places are
  either closed on Sa turdays or open only until noon, a practice that seems
  defy all business and marketing logic. Sundays will make you feel, if you're
  over 30, in a time warp. Remember in the 60's when Sunday was a &quot;church
  day,&quot; you went to grandma's house, and you ate at home and did no
  shopping because nothing wa s open? It's still like that in the UK. To
  be a little more accurate, this situation is rapidly changing: more and
  more places are opening on Sundays. Nonetheless the mindset still exists,
  and there are even still a few <EM>laws</EM> on the books that prevent
  &quot;Sunday Trading&quot; (I kid you not). Of course, whether you think
  Sunday Trading is a good idea or not depends a lot of which side of the
  counter you're on.</P>

  
  <P>In the UK, I find few restaurants are ever open before about 10:30 a.m.,
  so plan to have food at home for breakfast. You will also find that the
  nicer restaurants aren't open for dinner at five o'clock, or if they are,
  they will be empty. Most Brits have a tea break (i.e. snack) around four
  or fi ve pm (yes, they <EM>really</EM> do this), which means they aren't
  much in the mood for a meal out until around 8pm. Oh yes, in case you didn't
  already know, pubs close at 11 p.m. (it's illegal to serve liquor after
  11pm, unless you're a restaurant). A practice that seems to defy all logic
  at fir st is that take-out places (Chip shops, Kebab shops) might be closed
  in the evening yet suddenly open at 11pm. Why? Because of pub closing time,
  when hungry customers flood the street. Now, about food at Pubs: people
  tell you all the time that pubs are a place to get food (I've had delicious
  la sagne at a number of pubs), but what they <EM>don't</EM> bother to mention
  is that this is mainly a lunchtime affair. The menu may be on the wall,
  but they'll look at you strangely and say &quot;I don't think there's anything
  left&quot; if you try to order something after two p.m.</P>

  
  <P>If you find the pattern of hours that things are opened frustrating,
  you can always go to the American chains (Pizza Hut, MacDonalds, Burger
  King, 7-11 and KFC); they all follow American style hours!</P>

  
  <P><A HREF="#questions">Back to list of questions...</A></P>

  
  <H3><A NAME="sexrace"></A>Sexism and Racism</H3>

  
  <P>I've tried to convey that the UK is a friendly, civilized place for
  all people who visit or live there, and I think it is. You probably will
  not experience any blatant racism or sexism because people try very hard
  to be nice. However, you may experience it in more subtle forms. Although
  I'm n o expert, here are a few things I've learned or noticed.</P>

  
  <P>Is the UK a sexist place? While educated women in the UK are very informed
  about feminism, you will find that modern feminist thinking has not yet
  seeped into the culture quite to the degree it has in the US. Women tend
  to accept traditional roles with less protest. One of our first culture
  s hocks was during an interview with a landlady in which she said she'd
  be willing to knock the price down a bit if my wife did some babysitting
  now and then. Also, even liberal-minded women seem to dutifully shave their
  legs and underarms here; similarly &quot;going braless&quot; is seen more
  infrequently th an in the US. The same women don't bat an eye when a female
  in her twenties is referred to as &quot;a girl.&quot; I'm not sure to what
  extent discrimination in the workplace is worse here than in the US, but
  the sense of &quot;male bastions&quot; is pretty strong, and there certainly
  seem to be fewer laws in place t o prevent it. The hours that shops and
  laundramats keep (i.e. closed at night) send a clear message that the society
  still thinks that one member of the family (guess who) is at home during
  the day. When we filled out an application for a birth certificate there
  is an &quot;occupation&quot; line for the fa ther, but no such line for
  the mother. Even more sinister is the fact that if you are a married student
  coming to study abroad, a male may granted a VISA for his wife, but female
  student will be denied one for her husband. All this being said, I must
  emphasize that on a day-to-day basis the UK do es not seem very sexist.
  I think that attitudes have run somewhat ahead of actual laws so far.</P>

  
  <P>Is the UK a racist place? It's a sad but commonly observed fact that
  white people tend to breeze through customs and immigrations, while people
  of color are stopped and questioned with more frequency. If you are Indian
  or Pakistani, you should realize that Asians (which is what they call India
  ns and Pakistanis in the UK) are generally on a lower societal rung here
  than they are in the US, and you may find you are treated in subtly different
  ways here. But before you make up your mind about the UK in this regard,
  be aware that only 2.8% of the UK consists of non-whites (although another
  source puts it at 5.5%), whereas in the US it is 13.9% (source: CIA Guide).
  As a person from &quot;melting pot&quot; America, think twice before applying
  the same yardstick to the UK that you use for the US.</P>

  <H3><A NAME="great"></A>My list of what's great about living in the UK</H3>

  
  <UL>
    <LI>Pubs: an essential part of the social infrastructure, unlike anything
    in the US. Pubs are hardly at all like US &quot;bars&quot;, being much
    cozier, friendly (usually) and not sleazy (usually).
    <LI>Fabulous beers and ales. You'll be spoiled for life.
    <LI>Fabulous natural and historical sites all over the UK, all reachable
    within a day. Dozens of trips worth taking (see a guidebook). My personal
    favorite is the western highlands of Scotland.
    <LI>There really are unspoiled &quot;olde worlde&quot; towns in all sorts
    of places in the UK that still look very much like they did several hundreds
    of years ago. And these aren't just &quot;heritage sites&quot;, but places
    you can actually live.
    <LI>The opportunity to view your own country in a completely different
    light. Come to learn US history better and understand what makes it unique.
    Gives you a grasp on the American national identity. Make a hobby out of
    comparing US and UK cultures, and see how other countries view us.
    <LI>Getting to experience a foreign culture without the inconvenience of
    a language barrier.
    <LI>Cheap and easy travel to the continent. A ferry to France from where
    I am costs less than a round trip ticket to London! Package weekend deals
    to Paris including flight and hotel for less than $200 during the off-season.
    <LI>The excitement of having many cultures in a smaller place. The European
    Union is making life particularly interesting here.
    <LI>A fabulous rail system that goes seemingly everywhere
    <LI>In a word, &quot;civilized.&quot; People are much more agreeable and
    less conflict-prone than in the US; they solve problems by talking things
    through rather than arguing and posturing. People in positions of authority
    tend to consider the facts more thoughtfully instead of making inappropriate
    snap ju dgments.
    <LI>Slower pace of life. People tend to really leave work at 5pm and go
    home, and not come into work on weekends. Everyone gets about six weeks
    of vacation here. All of this is much more conducive to a better family
    life.
    <LI>A sense of a social safety net. Universal health care, so there's not
    that sense of grave fear of becoming unemployed that one has in the US.
    <LI>Personal safety. It will be a very long time before the UK becomes
    what Brits most fear: crime-ridden like the US (as they see it). A far
    larger proportion of areas in major cities are safe to walk in at night
    in the US than the UK. Places that Brits consider a &quot;bad neighborhood&quot;
    in the UK a re often quite benign by US standards.
    <LI>Common sense prevails. Although the UK gets its share of nuisance lawsuits,
    affirmative action laws gone out of control, and &quot;politically correct&quot;
    liberal parochialism, none of it is nearly acute as it has gotten in the
    US.
    <LI>Arguably better quality television. The junk on British TV is every
    bit as bad as the junk on US TV, but the best stuff in the UK tends to
    be a lot better than the US's best TV.

  <H2><A NAME="academic"></A>Do I want to be an academic in the UK?</H2>

  
  <P>A large number of people who request this FAQ are academics who are
  considering taking a position at a University in the UK. Since this was
  my own situation here, I thought I'd supply some information in that area.</P>

  
  <P>What is the research ranking of the department you are going to work
  for? All British universities are ranked on a 5-point scale for research
  excellence, and the standards are very high. A department with a five rating
  means that there are many faculty members with strong reputations and long
  publications lists; you can probably assume that it is competetive with
  the best department of its type anywhere in the world, and that it is probably
  drawing in huge amounts of research money. The rating review is performed
  every five years.</P>

  
  <P>The universities in the &quot;industrial north&quot; (Birmingham, Sheffield
  and Manchester) tend to have a slightly more &quot;practical flavor&quot;
  to them, with research funding tied to major industries (much like University
  of Michigan's ties to the auto industry). But this need not deter you,
  these are still three of the best research universities in the country.</P>

  
  <P>The word &quot;professor&quot; has a different meaning here. If you
  refer to some not particularly stellar junior colleague as a &quot;professor&quot;
  be prepared to be greeted with shock, or amusement (&quot;what, him, <EM>professor??</EM>&quot;).
  In the UK, &quot;professor&quot; is a rank of considerable seniority and
  distinction, roughly equivalent to what is called a &quot;full professor&quot;
  in the US. Other translations: assistant professor (US) = lecturer (UK),
  associate professor (US) = senior lecturer (UK).</P>

  
  <P>University lecturers in the UK are burdened with massive amounts of
  paperwork; it appears that the typical academic spends a larger proportion
  of his/her time on paperwork than in the US. The conservative government
  seems to have this idea that academics spend money frivilously, so they
  figure if you have to fill out three forms in triplicate for every move
  you make, that that will keep costs down.</P>

  
  <P>Prepare for a very different interview process. First, it is quite typical
  for all the candidates for the position to interview on a single day (so
  be prepared to meet your competitors). It is not the grueling whole-day
  affair that US interviews tend to be, where you are marched around to see
  dozens of future colleagues and deans. Rather, you'll give a presentation
  (not always!), and a 20-30 minute interview, maybe be given a cursory look
  around the department with your competitors, and that's all. Sometimes
  it happens that the committee makes their decision on the day of the intervie
  ws and tells you before you leave! If you give a presentation, for research-oriented
  departments this is the single most important component of your visit,
  so do it well. For your interview, be prepared to describe your work at
  differing levels of technicality; make it so someone outside your fie ld
  can get the basic message of what your work is about.</P>

  
  <P>This may be arguable, but the image of an academic here seems to be
  a little more casual, as though looking untidy is a sign of intelligence.
  This means men might get by with slightly longer hair than in the US; but
  I would still wear a suit of some sort to be safe.</P>

  
  <P>Here is the latest UK salary scale from April 1994. I'm not exactly
  sure how the different categories relate to the more familiar US categories;
  use your imagination.</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>&quot;Changing Places&quot; by David Lodge (Penguin Press): story about
    an American and a British professor who swap positions at their respective
    universities for a year. Extremely insightful and funny view of the cultural
    differences between our countries. Highly recommended! &quot;Small World&quot;
    is a followup novel by the same author. If you're going to Birmingham,
    these two novels, and his &quot;Nice Work&quot; are a must-read.
    <LI>The &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; stories (many different volumes)
    by John Mortimer. Deserves a place alongside Sherlock Holmes for great
    criminal fiction, although in this case from the view of a cynical trial
    lawyer rather than a detective.
    <LI>&quot;The British Museum is Falling Down&quot; by David Lodge (Penguin
    Press). Novel from the early 60's about a PhD student trying to get work
    done on his dissertation at the British Library.
    <LI>&quot;Lucky Jim&quot; by Kingsly Amis. Novel from the 50's about a
    recent college graduate stuggling to get by in his first year as a college
    lecturer.

    <LI>Paul Theroux, &quot;The Kingdom by the Sea&quot; (Penguin Press, 1983).
    A &quot;travel biography&quot;...author decides to see the UK by visiting
    every city along its permimeter, staying on foot as much as possible. Excessively
    cynical at times, but some good insights, and you'll learn about lesser-known
    plac es worth seeing.
    <LI>&quot;Coping With England&quot; by Jean Hannah (publ. Basil Blackwell,
    1987). A mostly factual quide of what to expect in England, not at all
    cynical as its title might suggest. Starting to get a bit out of date.
    <LI>&quot;Brit-Think/Amerithink, a Transatlantic Survival Guide,&quot;
    by Jane Walmsley (publ. Harrap London, 1990). Written by an American author.
    Pokes fun at the mindset of Americans and Brits with equal sarcasm. Very
    funny at times, although some of her ideas about Americans are odd (we
    don't all get plastic surgery, Jane), and she feels obliged to tell us
    what it's like being a TV producer in the UK (three guesses as to her occupation).
    <LI>&quot;British English, A to Zed&quot; by Norman Schur (publ. Harper
    Perennial, 1991). A dictionary of British words that are mostly unknown
    to Americans. Needs an update, but still pretty good. Very useful for reading
    British novels.
    <LI>&quot;An American Looks at Britain,&quot; by Robert Critchfield (1991).
    Recommended by someone on the net (I haven't seen it myself).
    <LI>&quot;The Underground Guide to University Study in Britain and Ireland,&quot;
    by Bill Griesar, Intercultural Press, 1992. Aimed at the foreign student,
    everything from a language glossary to the rules for cricket. (Also recommended
    by someone on the net.)
    <LI>&quot;How to Study and Live in Britain,&quot; by Jane Woolfenden. Northcote
    House, 1990. A bit more stolid, but lots of useful information (i.e. on
    registering with the police, immigration, etc). (Also recommended by someone
    on the net.)
    <LI>&quot;Studying and Living in Britain,&quot; by the British Council.
    Northcote House, 1991. Essentially a shorter version of Jane Woolfenden's
    book, although it's &quot;official.&quot; (Also recommended by someone
    on the net.)
    <LI>&quot;Driving in Britain: A North American's guide to the ins and outs
    and roundabouts of driving over there,&quot; by Robert A. Lockhart. Cande
    Marketing, PO Box 405, Don Mills, Ontario, Canada M3C 2T2. $12.95 plus
    $2.00 shipping and handling.
