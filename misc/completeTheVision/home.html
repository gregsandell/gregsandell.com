          <h3>What will the OSM Parish Center be?</h3>
          <p>The planned 17,000 square foot Parish Center will house some Parish offices closer to the front Michigan Avenue entrance, have multiple meeting/classroom spaces, and a gymnasium/social hall with a retractable performance stage. The project is estimated to cost $3.6 million. This cost includes demolition, construction, and facility equipment. If important milestones and fundraising deadlines are met, we hope to open the doors to the Parish Center in Fall 2015.</p>

          <h3>Why is an OSM Parish Center so important?</h3>
          <p>Strategically, we have a window of opportunity to move forward so that our entire Old St. Mary’s community can benefit from a new Parish Center as soon as possible. We have support from school and parish leaders as well as collaborative relationships with Archdiocese personnel.</p>
          <p>The current campus of Old St. Mary’s does not offer a gathering and social space large enough for our community’s needs. Old St. Mary’s Parish has grown by five time its size since 2002. Our school enrollment has increased from 18 students to over 350. The school needs appropriate space for its athletics and performing arts programs. Currently, school children have gym and practice sports off- campus at other church and school facilities.</p>
