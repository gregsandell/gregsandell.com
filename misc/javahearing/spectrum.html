<ul>
<li>If the applet did not successfully load, there is a
good chance that your browser is not Java 1.1 compliant.  Please read
the note on the <a href="/javahearing">main Javahearing page</a>.
<li>The first graphic that comes up is an empty space called the "Spectrum
Canvas", with frequency on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis.
Click somewhere in this canvas, and it will create a sine wave at the
frequency and amplitude that you choose.  This is now the fundmental
frequency for a complex harmonic spectrum.  You can add harmonics by clicking to
the right of the initial click.
<li>You can modify the amplitude of each partial by dragging the mouse
from the top of the line.
<li>Use the buttons below to view the waveform and listen to it.  The
waveform and audio will be modified in real time as you change the
values of the amplitudes.
<li>Use the button below to show the phases for this spectrum.  They are
all set at zero to start.  You can drag these values around with the
mouse in the same manner as above.  (Try "randomize phase", too.)  
<li>The sound may seem growly or tinny depending on the frequency of the
first harmonic you choose.  A recommended range for first values is
between 75-200 Hertz (see the bottom, or x-axis).  Enjoy!
